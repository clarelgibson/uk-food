# UK Food Hygiene Ratings

An exploration of food hygiene ratings in the UK.

## Description

Following on from the [farnham-food](https://github.com/clarelgibson/farnham-food) project, this project sets out to explore food hygiene ratings across the UK. The UK [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk) publishes [full ratings data](https://ratings.food.gov.uk) for every local authority in England and Wales. An explainer on the UK's Food Hygiene Rating Scheme can be found [here](https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme).

## Getting started

### Data

-   [UK food hygiene ratings by local authority](https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB) published by the [FSA]((https://www.food.gov.uk)). Data is refreshed daily.

### Packages
